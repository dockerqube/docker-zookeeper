# Zookeeper docker image

These images are part of the bigdata docker image series. All of the images use the same [base docker image](https://github.com/flokkr/docker-baseimage) which contains advanced configuration loading.

For more details go to the [organization page](https://github.com/flokkr/flokk).



## Configuration and extensions

The flokkr containers support multiple configuration loading mechanism and various extensions. All of the these are defined in the [flokkr baseimage](https://github.com/flokkr/docker-baseimage) and could be activated by environment variables.

The available plugins:

| Name      | Description                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| envtoconf | **Simple onfiguration loading**, suggested for stand-alone docker files. Converts environment variables to xml/property configuration based on naming convention |
| consul    | **Complex configuration loading from consul**, downloads configuration from consul server and restart when the configuration is changed. Suggested for multi-host setups. |
| btrace    | Instruments the java option with custom Btrace script (with modifying the JAVA_OPTS) |

### Plugin details

#### ENVTOCONF: Simple configuration loading

Could be activated by ```CONFIG_TYPE=simple``` settings, but it's the default.

Every configuration could be defined with environment variables, and they will be converted finally to *hadoop xml, properties, conf* or other format. The destination format (and the destination file name) is defined with the name of the environment variable according to a naming convention.

The generated files will be saved to the `$CONF_DIR` directory.

The source code of the converter utility can be found in a [separated repository](https://github.com/elek/envtoconf).

##### Naming convention for set config keys from enviroment variables

To set any configuration variable you shold follow the following pattern:

```
NAME.EXTENSION_configkey=VALUE
```

The extension could be any extension which has a predefined transformation (currently xml, yaml, properties, configuration, yaml, env, sh, conf, cfg)

examples:

```
CORE-SITE_fs.default.name: "hdfs://localhost:9000"
HDFS-SITE_dfs_namenode_rpc-address: "localhost:9000"
HBASE-SITE.XML_hbase_zookeeper_quorum: "localhost"
```

In some rare cases the transformation and the extension should be different. For example the kafka `server.properties` should be in the format `key=value` which is the `cfg` transformation in our system. In that case you can postfix the extension with an additional format specifier:


```
NAME.EXTENSION!FORMAT_configkey=VALUE
```

For example:

```
SERVER.CONF!CFG_zookeeper.address=zookeeper:2181
```

##### Available transformation

*  xml: HADOOP xml file format

*  properties: key value pairs with ```:``` as separator

*  cfg: key value pairs with ```=``` as separator

*  conf: key value pairs with space as spearator (spark-defaults is an example)

*  env: key value paris with ```=``` as separator

*  sh: as the env but also includes the export keyword

     ##### Configuration reference

     The plugin itself could be configured with the following environment variables.

   | Name        | Default                                  | Description                              |
   | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
   | CONF_DIR    | *Set in the docker container definitions* | The location where the configuration files will be saved. |
   | CONFIG_TYPE | simple                                   | For compatibility reason. If the value is simple, the conversion is active. |

#### CONSUL: Consul config loading

Could be activated with ```CONFIG_TYPE=consul```

* The starter script list the configuration file names based on a consul key prefix. All the files will be downloaded from the consul key value store and the application process will be started with consul-template (enable an automatic restart in case of configuration file change)

The source code of the consul based configuration loading and launcher is available at the [elek/consul-launcher](https://github.com/elek/consul-launcher) repository.

| Name        | Default                                  | Description                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| CONF_DIR    | *Set in the docker container definitions* | The location where the configuration files will be saved. |
| CONFIG_TYPE | consul                                   | For compatibility reason. If the value is consul, the consul based configuration handling is active. |
| CONSUL_PATH | conf                                     | The path of the subtree in the consul where the configurations are. |
| CONSUL_KEY  |                                          | The  path where the configuration for this container should be downloaded from. The effective path will be ```$CONSUL_PATH/$CONSUL_KEY``` |

#### BTRACE: btrace instrumentation

Could be enabled with setting ```BTRACE_ENABLED=true``` or just setting ```BTRACE_SCRIPT```.

It adds btrace javaagent configuration to the JAVA_OPTS (or any other opts defined by BTRACE_OPTS_VAR). The standard output is redirected to ```/tmp/output.log```, and the btrace output will be displayed on the standard output (over a ```/tmp/btrace.out``` file)

| Name            | Default                                  | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| CONF_DIR        | *Set in the docker container definitions* | The location where the configuration files will be saved. |
| BTRACE_SCRIPT   | <notset>                                 | The location of the compiled btrace script. Coule be absolute or relative to the ```/opt/plugins/020_btrace/btrace``` |
| BTRACE_OPTS_VAR | JAVA_OPTS                                | The name of the shell variable where the agent parameters should be injected. |


#### Configuration

* `CONSUL_PATH` defines the root of the subtree where the configuration are downloaded from. The root could also contain a configuration `config.ini`. Default is `conf`

* `CONSUL_KEY` is optional. It defines a subdirectory to download the the config files. If both `CONSUL_PATH` and `CONSUL_KEY` are defined, the config files will be downloaded from `$CONSUL_PATH/$CONSUL_KEY` but the config file will be read from `$CONSUL_PATH/config.ini`

## Examples

For getting started use the included docker-compose file and start both hdfs and yarn clusters:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You can adjust the settings in the docker-compose file according to the naming convention.

## Smoketest

```
docker-compose exec zookeeper zkCli.sh
ls /
```


## Versioning policy

  The _latest_ tag points to the latest configuration loading and the latest stable apache version.

  If there is plain version tag without prefix it is synchronized with the version of the original apache software.

  It there is a prefix (eg. HDP) it includes a specific version from a specific vendor distribution.

  As the configuration loading in the base image is constantly evolving even the tags of older releases may be refreshed over the time.

  Images are build with travis with matrix parameters and uploaded to the docker hub from travis.
